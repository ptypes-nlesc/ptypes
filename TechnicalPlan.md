## Aproach to the problem

The problem is to identify stereotypes. We can approach this problem in two ways:

- Top down: Use data-driven approach to uncover stereotypes (topics) and their relationships in the data. Topic modelling techniques will be used. This approach does not require labelled data.
  
- Bottom up: Use predefined stereotypes to build a model that can be used to predict the stereotype of a given video. For this we need labelled data.
